In 1937, he published his classic book on military tactics, Infantry Attacks, drawing on his experiences in that war. In World War II, he commanded the 7th Panzer Division during the 1940 invasion of France. His leadership of German and Italian forces in the North African campaign established his reputation as one of the ablest tank commanders of the war, and earned him the nickname der Wüstenfuchs, \"the Desert Fox\". Among his British adversaries he had a reputation for chivalry, and his phrase \"war without hate\" has been uncritically used to describe the North African campaign.[2] A number of historians have since rejected the phrase as a myth and uncovered numerous examples of German war crimes and abuses towards enemy soldiers and native populations in Africa during the conflict.[3] Other historians note that there is no clear evidence Rommel was involved or aware of these crimes,[4] with some pointing out that the war in the desert, as fought by Rommel and his opponents, still came as close to a clean fight as there was in World War II.[5] He later commanded the German forces opposing the Allied cross-channel invasion of Normandy in June 1944.\\n\\nAfter the Nazis gained power in Germany, Rommel gradually accepted the new regime. Historians have given different accounts of the specific period and his motivations.[6] He was a supporter of Adolf Hitler, at least until near the end of the war, if not necessarily sympathetic to the party and the paramilitary forces associated with it.[7] In 1944, Rommel was implicated in the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler. Because of Rommel\\'s status as a national hero, Hitler wanted to eliminate him quietly instead of having him immediately executed, as many other plotters were. Rommel was given a choice between suicide, in return for assurances that his reputation would remain intact and that his family would not be persecuted following his death, or facing a trial that would result in his disgrace and execution; he chose the former and took a cyanide pill.[8] Rommel was given a state funeral, and it was announced that he had succumbed to his injuries from the strafing of his staff car in Normandy.\\n\\nRommel became a larger-than-life figure in both Allied and Nazi propaganda, and in postwar popular culture. Numerous authors portray him as an apolitical, brilliant commander and a victim of Nazi Germany, although other authors have contested this assessment and called it the \"Rommel myth\". Rommel\\'s reputation for conducting a clean war was used in the interest of the West German rearmament and reconciliation between the former enemies – the United Kingdom and the United States on one side and the new Federal Republic of Germany on the other. Several of Rommel\\'s former subordinates, notably his chief of staff Hans Speidel, played key roles in German rearmament and integration into NATO in the postwar era. The German Army\\'s largest military base, the Field Marshal Rommel Barracks, Augustdorf, and a third ship of Lütjens-class destroyer of the German Navy are both named in his honour. His son Manfred Rommel was the longtime mayor of Stuttgart, Germany and namesake of Stuttgart Airport')]"

When looking specifically at the comprehensive costs on society of\\nnonfatal injuries, upper limb injuries account for 16% and lower limb injuries accountfor 38%, attributing well more than 50% of the total costs on society for nonfatal in-\\njuries to the extremities.\\n2Furthermore, of those working before an injury from a mod-\\nerate to high-energy force with an orthopedic injury with an Abbreviated Injury Scale(AIS) of 3 or more, only 58% have returned to work at 1 year.\\n3This gives orthopedic\\nsurgeons the opportunity to have a significant impact on minimizing this burden by do-\\ning their part to optimize outcomes of those with extremity injuries.\\nNEED FOR A COORDINATED NATIONAL TRAUMA SYSTEM TO OPTIMIZE OUTCOMES\\nHaving an established and optimized trauma system is essential to improve the out-\\ncomes of those who sustain high-energy extremity trauma. Research clearly demon-\\nstrates that those sustaining severe lower-limb injuries benefit from treatment at atrauma center.\\n4,5Interestingly enough, although the total number of trauma centers\\nis increasing throughout the United States, the number of severe orthopedic injuries\\nseen at these centers seems to be decreasing, which ultimately results in less trauma\\nvolume per orthopedic surgeon.6The American College of Surgeons Committee on\\nTrauma has recognized this dilemma and has published a position statement outlining\\nseveral guidelines for the optimization of a regional trauma system, which seeks to\\nbest serve the needs of the injured patient.7In addition, through the establishment\\nof a coordinated National Trauma System, which may be on the horizon in the United\\nStates, outcomes of extremity trauma patients are likely to improve.8\\nTRAUMA-RELATED MORTALITY\\nIn the developed world, trauma is the most common cause of death in those younger\\nthan the age of 44 years and is most commonly due to road traffic accidents. Donald\\nTrunkey9described a predictable trimodal distribution of death in 1983.\\nAcute or Primary Mortality\\nThe casualties that belong in this group are ones that have sustained injuries that are\\nincompatible with life. Typical injuries include severe head injuries, major hemorrhage,high cervical vertebra (C3 and above) and spinal cord injuries, airway obstruction, ormediastinal and cardiac disruption. Casualties often succumb to these injuries within\\nseconds because they are not amenable to medical intervention regardless of the\\ntimeline.\\nSecondary Mortality\\nDeath in the second peak usually occurs within minutes to hours and is potentially pre-ventable by early and appropriate medical intervention. Examples of early or acute in-\\njuries in this group are intracranial hemorrhage, pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade,\\nhemothorax, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, pelvic fracture, or long bone fracture, inparticular femoral fractures. All of these are characterized by the need for early inva-\\nsive medical intervention to stabilize the casualty before physiologic disruption and or-\\ngan failure occurs. For the orthopedic surgeon, interventions include pelvis and longbone stabilization; however, it is important for them to be aware that patients with\\nthese injuries often require significant resuscitation.\\nTertiary Mortality\\nThirty percent of all trauma-related deaths occur within days or weeks following the\\ninjury.10The triggering of multiorgan failure and subsequent death is usually on aStinner & Edwards 1120'),\n",

This concept of multiple, progressiveor sequential systems failure was first described in 1975 by Baue.\\n10The term multior-\\ngan dysfunction syndrome has been adopted to describe this condition and is char-\\nacterized by the failure of at least 2 organs.\\nThe goal of the orthopedic surgeon is to attempt to prevent secondary or tertiary\\ndeaths and subsequently minimize morbidity related to musculoskeletal injury. Typi-\\ncally, mortality in the secondary peak can be minimized by stabilization of fracturesto the pelvis and long bones. Stabilization of such injuries not only helps with the\\nreduction of blood loss but also deceases the pain stimuli, reducing the analgesia\\nand anesthetic requirement, which can help with the regulation and normalization ofphysiology. Furthermore, stabilization of the long bones can also minimize the riskof pulmonary complications due to fat emboli and inability to mobilize.\\nADVANCED TRAUMA LIFE SUPPORT\\nDuring the primary survey, the orthopedic surgeon can assist in the management ofmusculoskeletal injuries that have a direct impact on the primary survey or injuries\\nthat are diagnosed during primary investigations. Overtly fractured limbs impeding\\nassessment, the fractured pelvis with hemodynamic instability, and open long bonefractures with ongoing hemorrhage are all indications for the early intervention by\\nthe orthopedic surgeon. As the orthopedic surgeon identifies these injuries, they\\nmust stay in continual communication with the trauma team leader because theymay affect resuscitation strategies.\\nRestoring gross length and alignment of fractures and stabilizing long bone and/or\\npelvic ring fractures with splints and/or a pelvic binder can minimize further blood loss,\\nbone and soft tissue trauma, and reduce patient pain and analgesia requirement.However, it should be noted that resuscitation and the primary survey always take pre-\\ncedence over splinting of extremity fractures.\\nOf note, missed extremity injuries, especially in the hand and foot, can occur in more\\nthan 8% of trauma patients, which emphasizes the importance of repeat assess-\\nment.\\n11A low threshold for a high index of suspicion of spinal injuries should also\\nbe considered in an unconscious patient and triple immobilization should be main-tained until formal clinical evaluation is possible. If this is not possible due to a persis-tent unconscious or anesthetized patient, spine-specific imaging, computed\\ntomography (CT), and MRI should be performed before removal of the immobilization.\\nAdjuncts to the secondary survey include further radiographic imaging. It is nowcommonplace to perform a trauma protocol CT scan that may replace the need for\\nother radiographs.\\n12\\nORTHOPEDICS IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT: EARLY INTERVENTIONS CAN\\nIMPROVE OUTCOMES\\nAlthough the orthopedic surgeon may not be directly involved in the primary survey of\\nthe severely injured patient, their acute management of several conditions can have adramatic effect on the patient’s overall outcome.\\nMajor Hemorrhage\\nThe patient who presents in major hemorrhage is often in extremis.

In the setting of a traumatic amputation, a tour-niquet should be applied if hemorrhage control is needed and then it can be reas-\\nsessed in the operating room.\\nOpen Fractures\\nOpen fractures involve a direct communication of the injured bone with the environ-\\nment and are often the reflection of a high-energy injury. Not only does the potential\\nfor contamination worsen the injury burden but the high energy indicates severe dam-\\nage to the local soft tissues, both leading to wound complications and an increasedpotential for infection.

The extremity often feels tight and the soft tissues are lesscompressible than the contralateral limb. ACS remains a clinical diagnosis; however,\\ntools to measure intramuscular pressure and tissue oxygenation can be used to\\nconfirm the clinical diagnosis, which can be extremely useful in making the diagnosisin the obtunded patient. When obtaining intramuscular pressure measurements, a dif-\\nference of less than 30 mm Hg from the diastolic blood pressure is concerning for\\nACS. Once ACS is diagnosed, emergent fasciotomies are performed to relieve thepressure and prevent further myoneural ischemia.\\nVascular Injury\\nA vascular injury should be suspected if the injured extremity shows signs of pallor,reduced temperature, prolonged capillary refill, and reduced pulses. Before further ex-\\namination, gross limb length and alignment should be obtained and the limb re-\\nexamined. The ankle-brachial index should be obtained if a vascular injury is sus-pected with a value of 0.90 or lower having a high positive predictive value for an asso-ciated vascular injury.\\n25Re-establishment of the blood supply to the limb is an\\nemergency because muscle necrosis begins to occur within 6 hours of injury. Close\\ncoordination with the vascular surgeon is vital because each surgical plan dependson the other. The sequence of the surgical procedure must be discussed to maximize\\ncare and minimize the ischemia time and risk of further injury to the patient and\\nvascular repair if skeletal stabilization is done after the vascular repair.\\nMajor Joint Dislocations\\nThe close proximity and tethering of neurovascular structures to joints places them atsignificant risk of injury in joint dislocation. Localized soft-tissue swelling, distal ex-tremity edema, abnormal neurology or the signs of vascular compromise are all\\nmarkers for a high index of suspicion of a major joint dislocation. Expedient joint relo-\\ncation and stabilization in a splint or traction may be necessary. Unlike most disloca-tions, a hip dislocation is considered an orthopedic emergency and should be reducedimmediately on recognition because an increased time to reduction is associated with\\nsubsequent development of avascular necrosis.\\n26\\nSCORING SYSTEMS: ARE THEY RELIABLE?\\nThe decision to perform limb salvage or an amputation remains difficult. Scoring sys-tems, such as the Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS)\\n27and Limb Salvage In-\\ndex (LSI),28have been developed to help guide surgeons in their decision-making\\nprocess. However, the decision to salvage or amputate a limb often requires more fac-\\ntors to be considered than those commonly used in the scoring systems. As a result,\\ntheir utility came into question and, in 2001, Bosse and colleagues29found that, out of\\nall scoring systems evaluated, the MESS; the LSI; the Predictive Salvage Index; theNerve Injury, Ischemia, Soft-Tissue Injury, Skeletal Injury, Shock, and Age of Patient\\nScore; and the Hannover Fracture scale-98, none were able to predict the need for\\namputation in a large, multicenter prospective observational study. In 2008, Ly andcolleagues\\n30followed the same set of patients and found that the same scoring sys-\\ntems also lacked the ability to predict outcome and patient recovery following high-\\nenergy lower extremity trauma. Scoring systems also do not seem to have utilitywhen treating severe combat injuries, as demonstrated by Sheean and colleagues.\\n31\\nOther clinical examination findings have been considered in the decision-making\\nprocess, such as the presence of plantar sensation on presentation. In fact, theStinner & Edwards 1124'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'MSK_trauma.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='absence of plantar sensation has historically been a primary reason for orthopedic and\\ngeneral surgeons to consider acute amputation.32However, an analysis performed by\\nBosse and colleagues33of subjects presenting without plantar sensation compared\\nwith matched controls following high-energy trauma demonstrated no difference in\\noutcomes between groups at 2 years. Therefore, the treating surgeon should use allfactors that are available in helping to make the decision and not hang their hat on\\n1 scoring system or 1 primary clinical examination finding. In addition, when time per-\\nmits, that is, the patient is not in extremis, it is always helpful to confer with colleagues,other members of the trauma team, and, when able, the patient before the decision is\\nmade to amputate or salvage a severely injured extremity because there may be other\\nfactors to consider.\\nWHEN SHOULD IT BE FIXED?\\nOne of the frequent discussions among orthopedic and general surgeons revolvesaround the appropriate timing to stabilize fractures. Although the discussion is often\\nshort and indications for urgent operative stabilization in those with isolated extrem-\\nities is rather clear, the discussion can be longer and may involve multiple servicesin the polytrauma patient because more factors must be considered to ensure thatthe surgical intervention does not increase patient morbidity. Ideally, the right surgery\\nis performed for each patient, personally tailored to their physiologic status. The term\\nused to describe this is the application of early appropriate care (EAC). However, toapply EAC, what constitutes appropriate care must be understood. To do so, it is help-\\nful to understand both sides of the historical argument between early total care (ETC)\\nand damage control orthopedics (DCO), which can be used to selectively provideappropriate care, depending on the patient’s clinical status and response to resusci-\\ntation. Although most research evaluating optimal timing of fracture fixation is\\ncentered on the femur, the principles can be applied to fractures of other long bonesand the pelvic ring.\\nEarly Total Care\\nPatients with unstable fractures of the femur, pelvis, acetabulum, and spine are oftenforced into a recumbent position, which predisposes them to pulmonary complica-\\ntions and prolonged systemic inflammation. Early stabilization of these injuries can\\nlead to improved pain relief and mobility. Several studies have clearly demonstratedthe benefits of ETC. Harvin and colleagues\\n34published their decade of experience\\ncomparing femur fractures definitively stabilized with intramedullary nails before and\\nafter 24 hours. After adjusting for anatomic (Injury Severity Score [ISS]) and physio-logic (Revised Trauma Score) indices, early fracture fixation was independently asso-\\nciated with a reduction in pulmonary complications by nearly 60%. It was also\\nassociated with a reduction in ventilator days, hospital length of stay, and overall hos-pital charges. These results are similar to those demonstrated by Vallier and col-leagues,\\n35who compared definitive fixation of unstable femur, acetabulum, pelvis,\\nand thoracolumbar fractures performed before and after 24 hours. After adjusting\\nfor age and ISS, days in the intensive care unit and total hospital stay were lowerwith early fixation. In addition, there were greater than 10% fewer overall complica-\\ntions (24% vs 35.8%), and lower rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome\\n(ARDS), pneumonia, and sepsis in those undergoing early versus delayed fixation.\\nAs this evidence suggests, early definitive treatment may be safely used for patients\\nwith multiple injuries. However, ETC is not ideal for all patients because there is a clear\\nsubset of patients who benefit from DCO.Musculoskeletal Trauma 1125'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'MSK_trauma.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='Damage Control Orthopedics\\nAs the pendulum swung toward ETC, it was realized that not all patients did well hav-\\ning their fractures undergo definitive stabilization early. In fact, some types of patientsseemed to do quite poorly with ETC. It became apparent that in certain patients,\\nparticularly those with pulmonary or head injuries, a less aggressive approach to frac-\\nture fixation might be needed. Trauma causes a sustained response of the immunesystem and the early hyperinflammatory response is often followed by a hypoinflam-\\nmatory stage. In the polytrauma patient, extended surgery, which can lead to\\nincreased blood loss, hypothermia, and surgical trauma, can result in an excessive in-flammatory reaction, which has been termed the second hit. In these patients, exten-\\nsive surgical procedures can overwhelm the immune system, which can trigger a\\npulmonary complication, such as ARDS, or multiple organ failure.\\n36\\nOne alternative is delayed fracture care, that is, splinting or traction, of unstable\\nfractures and performing surgical skeletal stabilization days to weeks later. Before\\nthe advent of modern surgical skeletal stabilization techniques, this was the norm.There are, however, significant disadvantages to delayed fracture care. In patientswithout adequate stabilization, in the case of the femur this would usually involve\\nsome form of skeletal traction, patients cannot be mobilized. As a result, they are at\\nan increased risk for pulmonary complications and pressure ulcers. With the advance-ment in surgical skeletal stabilization techniques, there was a shift toward aggressive\\nearly stabilization of extremity fractures but, as alluded to earlier, ETC is not appro-\\npriate for everyone. Thus, the emergence of DCO.\\nDCO involves doing the necessary surgical interventions to stabilize the fracture to\\nminimize excessive blood loss, improve pain, and promote mobilization. This usually in-\\nvolves procedures such as external fixation of long bone fractures or unstable pelvic ringinjuries. Through the placement of external fixation in the acute period, that is, avoidingopen and often lengthy and/or bloody surgical procedures, the second hit is theoretically\\navoided and definitive reconstruction can occur at a later point after the patient’s phys-\\niologic parameters have improved. The benefits of this strategy on the immune systemhave been demonstrated by Pape and colleagues.\\n37In a prospective, randomized, multi-\\ncenter study, 35 polytrauma subjects (ISS >16) with a diaphyseal femur fracture were ran-\\ndomized to either ETC or DCO, and serum inflammatory markers were trended over time.In those with ETC (intramedullary nail), there was a sustained increase in serum inflamma-\\ntory markers, which was not seen in the DCO group following both the initial external fix-\\nation and subsequent conversion to definitive fixation with an intramedullary nail.\\nIn a retrospective study, Harwood and colleagues\\n38compared the Systemic Inflam-\\nmatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) Score and Marshall multiorgan dysfunction score\\nof subjects with femur fractures treated with either ETC or DCO. It was not surprisingthat the DCO group had more severe injuries based on the new ISS, and more headand thoracic injuries. Despite this, they had a smaller, shorter postoperative SIRS and\\ndid not suffer significantly more pronounced organ failure than the ETC group. Interest-\\ningly, those in the DCO group who underwent conversion to an intramedullary nail whentheir SIRS score was raised suffered the most pronounced subsequent inflammatory\\nresponse and organ failure, which emphasizes the impact that the second hit can have\\nand the importance of planning the definitive fixation based on physiologic improvement.\\nEarly Appropriate Care: When to Choose Early Total Care Versus Damage Control\\nOrthopedics\\nWhat is very clear is that stable patients should be treated with ETC, whereas unstable\\npatients should undergo DCO.

In patients\\nundergoing definitive fixation of a femur fracture with an intramedullary nail within24 hours of injury, admission lactate is significantly associated with pulmonary com-\\nplications when other factors such as age, Glasgow Coma Scale, and AIS were\\ncontrolled. However, preoperative lactate was not found to be a risk factor.\\n40A me-\\ndian preoperative lactate of 2.8 mmol/L was not associated with increased pulmonary\\ncomplications, as opposed to previous publications.41These results are similar to\\nthose seen by Vallier and colleagues35,42in which admission lactate, in addition to\\nthe severity of the abdominal and thoracic injuries, contribute most to the develop-\\nment of pulmonary morbidity. It is likely that the trend in lactate, that is, a lactate level\\nimproving and approaching 2.5 mmol/L, demonstrates an adequate response toresuscitation and, therefore, can lead to safe application of ETC. On the contrary, inthose with closed head injuries, severe abdominal, or severe thoracic injuries, DCO\\nshould be considered.\\nThis was also demonstrated in a review by Vallier and colleagues\\n42of subjects with\\npelvis, acetabulum, spine, and/or proximal or diaphyseal femur fractures treated sur-\\ngically. Pulmonary complications occurred in 12% of subjects with 8.2% developing\\npneumonia. Lactate levels were greater with pulmonary complications and were thesingle most specific predictor of complications. An uncomplicated course was asso-\\nciated with absence of a chest injury and definitive fixation within 24 or 48 hours. The\\ninvestigators concluded that complications can be minimized when isolated fracturesare treated on early and, when patients have injuries to other body systems and/or se-vere hemorrhage, DCO may be advisable to optimize outcomes.\\nIn summary, if the patient demonstrates any physiologic signs of end-organ hypo-\\nperfusion, DCO should be pursued. It is also important for the orthopedic surgeon tocommunicate with both the general surgeon and the anesthetist so that care is opti-\\nmized. This allows the treatment plan to be altered in an effort to optimize the patient’s\\noutcomes if the patient’s physiologic parameters change throughout the resuscitationprocess or surgical procedure.\\nSUMMARY\\nSevere extremity injuries are not only a challenge to treat but doing so results in high\\nresource utilization and often high levels of levels of disability.3,43The decision to pur-\\nsue DCO versus ETC may lead to a shorter hospital stay and fewer complications, butthere is likely more that surgeons can do optimize patient outcomes throughout the\\nentire care continuum beyond the decisions made or actions taken within the first\\nfew hours following injury.

While enhancing user interactivity requires minimizing time to first token (TTFT), increasing throughput requires increasing tokens per second. Improving one aspect often results in the decline of the other, making it difficult for data centers, cloud service providers (CSPs), and AI application providers to find the right balance.\\xa0\\nLeveraging the NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip can minimize these tradeoffs. This post explores how IT leaders and infrastructure decision makers can harness the converged memory architecture of NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip to boost TTFT in multiturn user interactions by up to 2x on the popular Llama 3 70B model, compared to x86-based NVIDIA H100 servers, without any tradeoffs to system throughput.\\nKey-value cache offloading\\nLLM models are rapidly gaining adoption across various use cases, including question answering, summarization, and code generation. Before responding to a user’s prompt, these models must build a contextual understanding of the input sequence and any additional information retrieved during the inference request, such as in the case of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\\xa0\\nThis process involves converting the user’s prompt to tokens, and then to highly dense vectors, followed by extensive dot product operations to build a mathematical representation of the relationship between all the token’s in the prompt. The operations are repeated across the different layers of the model. The amount of compute required to generate the contextual understanding of the prompt scales quadratically with the size of the input sequence length.\\nThis compute-intensive process, which generates the key-value cache, or KV cache, is only required during the generation of the first token of the output sequence. Those values are then stored for later reuse when subsequent output tokens are generated, with new values appended as required. This dramatically reduces the amount of compute required to generate new tokens and, ultimately, the time it takes for the LLM to generate an output, improving the user experience.\\xa0\\nReusing a KV cache avoids the need to recompute it from scratch, reducing inference time and compute resources. However, in situations where user interaction with an LLM-based service is intermittent or if multiple LLM users need to interact with the same KV cache but at different times, storing the KV cache in GPU memory for long periods can waste valuable resources that could be better allocated to handle new incoming user requests, reducing overall system throughput.\\xa0\\nTo address this challenge, the KV cache can be offloaded from GPU memory to higher capacity and lower cost CPU memory, and then reloaded back to GPU memory once idle users resume their activity or new users interact with the same piece of content. This method, known as KV cache offloading, eliminates the need to recompute the KV cache without holding up valuable GPU memory.\\xa0\\nAddressing challenges of multiturn user interactions\\nKV cache offloading benefits content providers integrating generative AI capabilities into their platforms by enabling multiple users to interact with the same content—like summarizing a news article—without recalculating the KV cache for each new user. By computing the KV cache for the news article once, caching it in CPU memory, and then reusing it across multiple users, significant cost and user experience optimizations can be achieved.\\xa0\\nThis technique is also useful during code generation use cases, particularly in integrated development environments (IDEs) that have incorporated LLM capabilities. In this scenario, one or more developers can submit multiple prompts interacting with a single code script over extended periods of time. Offloading the initial KV cache calculations onto CPU memory and then reloading it for subsequent interactions avoids repeated recalculations and saves valuable GPU and infrastructure resources. Check out the NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM documentation for a detailed how-to guide on offloading and reusing the KV cache.\\nFor the Llama 3 70B model running on a server with NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs connected through PCIe to an x86 host processor, KV cache offloading can accelerate TTFT by up to 14x. This makes it a compelling deployment strategy for data centers, CSPs, and application providers seeking to serve LLMs cost effectively while maintaining positive user experiences.\\nFigure 1. In multiturn interactions, KV cache offloading for the Llama 3 70B model running on an NVIDIA H100 x86 GPU accelerates TTFT by up to 14x for large input sequence lengths compared to recalculating it from scratch\\nAccelerating KV cache offloading with NVIDIA GH200 converged CPU-GPU memory\\nIn traditional x86-based GPU servers, the KV cache offloading occurs over the 128 GB/s PCIe connection. For large batch sizes that include multiple multiturn user prompts, the slow PCIe interface can hamper performance, pushing TTFT above the 300 ms – 500 ms threshold typically associated with a realtime user experience.\\xa0\\nThe NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip overcomes the challenges of low speed PCIe interfaces. NVIDIA GH200 is a new class of superchip that brings together the Arm-based NVIDIA Grace CPU and NVIDIA Hopper GPU architectures using NVLink-C2C interconnect technology. NVLink-C2C delivers up to 900 GB/s total bandwidth between the CPU and the GPU. This is 7x higher bandwidth than the standard PCIe Gen5 lanes found in traditional x86-based GPU servers. Additionally, with GH200, the CPU and GPU share a single per-process page table, enabling all CPU and GPU threads to access all system-allocated memory that can reside on physical CPU or GPU memory.\\xa0\\nFigure 2. NVIDIA Grace Hopper architecture that leverages the 900 GB/s NVLink-C2C overcomes PCIe bottlenecks\\nOffloading KV cache for the Llama 3 70B model on GH200 delivers up to 2x more speedup for TTFT compared to offloading on x86-H100 in multiturn scenarios. This enables organizations deploying LLMs for where multiturn user interactions are frequent to increase user interactivity without any tradeoffs to overall system throughput.\\xa0\\nFigure 3. As a result of the 900 GB/s NVLink-C2C that connects the NVIDIA Grace CPU with the NVIDIA H200 GPU, offloading the KV cache for the Llama 3 70B model on a GH200 Superchip accelerates TTFT by up to 2x compared to on an x86-H100 GPU\\xa0\\nSuperior inference on Llama 3 with NVIDIA Grace Hopper and NVLink-C2C\\xa0\\nKV cache offloading is gaining traction among CSPs, data centers, and AI application providers due to its ability to improve TTFT in multiturn user interactions without degrading overall system throughput. By leveraging the 900 GB/s NVLink-C2C on the NVIDIA GH200 Superchip, inference on the popular Llama 3 model can be accelerated by up to 2x without any degradation to the system throughput. This enables organizations to improve user experience without additional infrastructure investments.\\nToday, NVIDIA GH200 powers nine supercomputers around the world, is offered by a wide array of system makers, and can be accessed on demand at cloud providers such as Vultr, Lambda, and CoreWeave. You can test NVIDIA GH200 for free through NVIDIA LaunchPad.\\n')]"

The Titan Speakerman is infected with a mind-control parasite developed by the toilets\\' second-in-command and chief strategist, \"Scientist Toilet\", causing the Titan Speakerman to turn on the alliance. The alliance is expanded to include a  species of TV-headed humanoids, and, with their help, Titan Speakerman is eventually cured.  \\nAs the military of both sides continue to advance technologically, the Titans attempt to hunt down G-Toilet. Though their combined powers are occasionally a match for his abilities, intervention by his legions each time allow him to escape. After a strike mission on the toilets\\' secret underground laboratory, the Scientist Toilet is finally defeated, but only one member of the team survives, a Cameraman called Plungerman. Having met a mysterious human seemingly involved in the creation of the toilets, the Plungerman is assassinated as a loose end. Meanwhile, fractures between the Skibidi Toilets and the \"Astro Toilets\", a mysterious splinter faction of powerful extraterrestrial toilets, erupt into violence, and the alliance and Skibidi Toilets enter into a makeshift alliance against their common enemy.\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\nThe show contains references to video games, such as G-Toilet having the face of the G-Man, a character from the Half-Life video game series. The Speakermen\\'s oft-performed dances are from the battle royale game Fortnite. Business Insider described the series as \"an endless arms race as both the toilets and their foes [produce] stronger fighters\".  Technology website Wired credited the largely dialogue-free nature of the show for removing language barriers and aiding in the show\\'s global popularity.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nSkibidi Toilet is produced by Alexey Gerasimov (Russian: Алексей Герасимов, born 1997 or 1998), who is also known by his alias \"Blugray\", or the name of his YouTube channel, \"DaFuq!?Boom!\" Since 2014, he has been learning animation on his own. He lives in the country of Georgia, though according to IrishStar.com, he is originally from Russia and only moved to Georgia in 2019. His channel has seen prior hits; his video I\\'M AT DIP accumulated over 45 million views by July 2023, for example.\\nThe first episode was released on 7 February 2023 (UTC), with an 11-second runtime. The video, entitled \"skibidi toilet\", depicts a toilet with a man\\'s head coming out of it singing a song which prominently features the word \"skibidi\". Every episode is produced using Source Filmmaker, a free Valve-published 3D computer graphics software, often used to create and edit clips and movies online. Some assets used in the series are taken from video games such as Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike: Source. The Skibidi Toilet in the first episode, for example, features the head model of a Civilian (Male_07) from Half-Life 2 (pictured '), Document(metadata={'title': 'Toilet humour', 'summary': 'Toilet humour, potty humour or scatological humour (compare scatology), is a type of off-colour humour dealing with defecation (including diarrhea and constipation), urination and flatulence, and to a lesser extent vomiting and other bodily functions. \\nToilet humour is commonly an interest of toddlers and young children, for whom cultural taboos related to acknowledgement of waste excretion still have a degree of novelty.

The humour comes from the rejection of such taboos, and is a part of modern culture.\\n\\n\\n== Music ==\\nToilet humour is sometimes found in song and rhyme, particularly schoolboy songs. Examples of this are found in Mozart and scatology, and variants of the German folk schoolboys\\' song known as the Scheiße-Lied (English: \"Shit-Song\") which is indexed in the German Volksliederarchiv. A children\\'s Spanish musical duo, Enrique y Ana, made a song called \"Caca Culo Pedo Pis\", which literally translates to \"Poop Butt Fart Pee\".\\nAmerican musician Matt Farley is known for writing and performing a multitude of songs related to urine, feces, vomit and various other bodily fluids under the pseudonym The Toilet Bowl Cleaners, including one of his most popular songs, entitled \"Poop in My Fingernails\". Farley has another pseudonym, The Odd Man Who Sings About Poop, Puke, and Pee. Many of his songs are just a person\\'s name alternating with the word \"poop\". Other songs include \"I Need a Lot of Toilet Paper to Clean the Poop in My Butt\".\\nDetroit rapper Eminem famously utilises crude humour throughout his discography. His most notorious example of toilet humour was featured on the 2017 album Revival, where he raps \"Your booty is heavy duty, like diarrhea\", a line which received extensive lament from critics. The Los Angeles Times comments: \"If Hannibal Lecter could have recorded a rap album, this would have been it. Brilliant, sinister, scatological and a parent\\'s nightmare.\"\\n\\n\\n== Performance ==\\nPaul Oldfield, who performed under the name Mr. Methane, performed a stage act that included him farting the notes of music. Joseph Pujol, who performed under the name Le Pétomane (French for \"fart maniac\"), performed a similar stage act for the Paris music hall scene.\\nThe American comedy duo Tim & Eric have made numerous comedy sketches based around toilet humour. For example, they have made fake commercials for non-existent products such as the \"Poop Tube\" (a device that lets people release liquefied faecal matter into a urinal while standing up), the \"fla\\'Hat\" (a hat that is connected to the wearer\\'s anus which expands when storing flatulence), and \"D-Pants\" (an undergarment invented by \"Diah Riha-Jones\" that captures \"uncontrollable diarrhea\").\\nIn the series South Park, the Canadian comedy duo Terrance and Phillip are noted for toilet humor and often make comedic use of their flatulence e.g. in the song ‘Unclefucker’.\\nEnglish actor Adrian Edmondson, who appeared in many shows utilising toilet humour, is quoted as saying, \"Toilet humour is like jazz: everybody has an idea what it is, and most people don\\'t like it. But the people who do like it are fervent about it and like it until they die.\"\\n\\n\\n== Books ==\\nIn 1929 comedian Charles \"Chic\" Sale published a small book, The Specialist, which was a large \"underground\" success. Its entire premise centered on sales of outhouses, touting the advantages of one kind or another, and labeling them in \"technical\" terms such as \"one-holers\", \"two-holers\", etc. Over a million copies were sold. In 1931 his monologue \"I\\'m a Specialist\" was made into a hit record (Victor 22859) by  recording artist Frank Crumit (music by Nels Bitterman). As memorialized in the \"Outhouse Wall of Fame\", the term \"Chic Sale\" became a rural slang synonym for privies, an appropriation of Mr. Sale\\'s name that he personally considered unfortunate.\\nMore recently, one of the most popular books about defecation, diarrhea and accidents in toilets is by straight-talking physician Jane Wilson-Howarth, a guide that began as Shitting Pr')]\n"

When looking specifically at the comprehensive costs on society of\\nnonfatal injuries, upper limb injuries account for 16% and lower limb injuries accountfor 38%, attributing well more than 50% of the total costs on society for nonfatal in-\\njuries to the extremities.\\n2Furthermore, of those working before an injury from a mod-\\nerate to high-energy force with an orthopedic injury with an Abbreviated Injury Scale(AIS) of 3 or more, only 58% have returned to work at 1 year.\\n3This gives orthopedic\\nsurgeons the opportunity to have a significant impact on minimizing this burden by do-\\ning their part to optimize outcomes of those with extremity injuries.\\nNEED FOR A COORDINATED NATIONAL TRAUMA SYSTEM TO OPTIMIZE OUTCOMES\\nHaving an established and optimized trauma system is essential to improve the out-\\ncomes of those who sustain high-energy extremity trauma. Research clearly demon-\\nstrates that those sustaining severe lower-limb injuries benefit from treatment at atrauma center.\\n4,5Interestingly enough, although the total number of trauma centers\\nis increasing throughout the United States, the number of severe orthopedic injuries\\nseen at these centers seems to be decreasing, which ultimately results in less trauma\\nvolume per orthopedic surgeon.6The American College of Surgeons Committee on\\nTrauma has recognized this dilemma and has published a position statement outlining\\nseveral guidelines for the optimization of a regional trauma system, which seeks to\\nbest serve the needs of the injured patient.7In addition, through the establishment\\nof a coordinated National Trauma System, which may be on the horizon in the United\\nStates, outcomes of extremity trauma patients are likely to improve.8\\nTRAUMA-RELATED MORTALITY\\nIn the developed world, trauma is the most common cause of death in those younger\\nthan the age of 44 years and is most commonly due to road traffic accidents. Donald\\nTrunkey9described a predictable trimodal distribution of death in 1983.\\nAcute or Primary Mortality\\nThe casualties that belong in this group are ones that have sustained injuries that are\\nincompatible with life. Typical injuries include severe head injuries, major hemorrhage,high cervical vertebra (C3 and above) and spinal cord injuries, airway obstruction, ormediastinal and cardiac disruption. Casualties often succumb to these injuries within\\nseconds because they are not amenable to medical intervention regardless of the\\ntimeline.\\nSecondary Mortality\\nDeath in the second peak usually occurs within minutes to hours and is potentially pre-ventable by early and appropriate medical intervention. Examples of early or acute in-\\njuries in this group are intracranial hemorrhage, pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade,\\nhemothorax, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, pelvic fracture, or long bone fracture, inparticular femoral fractures. All of these are characterized by the need for early inva-\\nsive medical intervention to stabilize the casualty before physiologic disruption and or-\\ngan failure occurs. For the orthopedic surgeon, interventions include pelvis and longbone stabilization; however, it is important for them to be aware that patients with\\nthese injuries often require significant resuscitation.\\nTertiary Mortality\\nThirty percent of all trauma-related deaths occur within days or weeks following the\\ninjury.10The triggering of multiorgan failure and subsequent death is usually on aStinner & Edwards 1120'),\n",

This concept of multiple, progressiveor sequential systems failure was first described in 1975 by Baue.\\n10The term multior-\\ngan dysfunction syndrome has been adopted to describe this condition and is char-\\nacterized by the failure of at least 2 organs.\\nThe goal of the orthopedic surgeon is to attempt to prevent secondary or tertiary\\ndeaths and subsequently minimize morbidity related to musculoskeletal injury. Typi-\\ncally, mortality in the secondary peak can be minimized by stabilization of fracturesto the pelvis and long bones. Stabilization of such injuries not only helps with the\\nreduction of blood loss but also deceases the pain stimuli, reducing the analgesia\\nand anesthetic requirement, which can help with the regulation and normalization ofphysiology. Furthermore, stabilization of the long bones can also minimize the riskof pulmonary complications due to fat emboli and inability to mobilize.\\nADVANCED TRAUMA LIFE SUPPORT\\nDuring the primary survey, the orthopedic surgeon can assist in the management ofmusculoskeletal injuries that have a direct impact on the primary survey or injuries\\nthat are diagnosed during primary investigations. Overtly fractured limbs impeding\\nassessment, the fractured pelvis with hemodynamic instability, and open long bonefractures with ongoing hemorrhage are all indications for the early intervention by\\nthe orthopedic surgeon. As the orthopedic surgeon identifies these injuries, they\\nmust stay in continual communication with the trauma team leader because theymay affect resuscitation strategies.\\nRestoring gross length and alignment of fractures and stabilizing long bone and/or\\npelvic ring fractures with splints and/or a pelvic binder can minimize further blood loss,\\nbone and soft tissue trauma, and reduce patient pain and analgesia requirement.However, it should be noted that resuscitation and the primary survey always take pre-\\ncedence over splinting of extremity fractures.\\nOf note, missed extremity injuries, especially in the hand and foot, can occur in more\\nthan 8% of trauma patients, which emphasizes the importance of repeat assess-\\nment.\\n11A low threshold for a high index of suspicion of spinal injuries should also\\nbe considered in an unconscious patient and triple immobilization should be main-tained until formal clinical evaluation is possible. If this is not possible due to a persis-tent unconscious or anesthetized patient, spine-specific imaging, computed\\ntomography (CT), and MRI should be performed before removal of the immobilization.\\nAdjuncts to the secondary survey include further radiographic imaging. It is nowcommonplace to perform a trauma protocol CT scan that may replace the need for\\nother radiographs.\\n12\\nORTHOPEDICS IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT: EARLY INTERVENTIONS CAN\\nIMPROVE OUTCOMES\\nAlthough the orthopedic surgeon may not be directly involved in the primary survey of\\nthe severely injured patient, their acute management of several conditions can have adramatic effect on the patient’s overall outcome.\\nMajor Hemorrhage\\nThe patient who presents in major hemorrhage is often in extremis.

In the setting of a traumatic amputation, a tour-niquet should be applied if hemorrhage control is needed and then it can be reas-\\nsessed in the operating room.\\nOpen Fractures\\nOpen fractures involve a direct communication of the injured bone with the environ-\\nment and are often the reflection of a high-energy injury. Not only does the potential\\nfor contamination worsen the injury burden but the high energy indicates severe dam-\\nage to the local soft tissues, both leading to wound complications and an increasedpotential for infection. Open fractures are commonly classified by 2 different systems.\\nThe more commonly used Gustilo-Anderson Classification and the newer Orthopaedic\\nTrauma Association’s Open Fracture Classification ( Boxes 1 and2).\\n15,16The most\\nimportant predictor of infection following open fracture seems to be timeliness of anti-\\nbiotic administration, with antibiotics given more than 60 minutes after injury being an\\nindependent risk factor for infection.17Typically, a first-generation cephalosporin is\\nrecommended with additional broader coverage only in certain scenarios.18Surgical\\ndebridement and irrigation should be performed within 24 hours, and ideally sooner\\ndepending on the level of contamination. The type of fixation, which can be either tem-porary or definitive, depends of the level of soft tissue injury and contamination. Whenrequired, wound coverage should be performed within 5 to 7 days.\\n17,19\\nFemur Fractures\\nIn the presence of hemodynamic instability and physiologic parameters that indicatehypovolemic shock, the assessment of circulation and hemorrhage involves the ex-\\namination of the lower extremity for swelling.

In fact, pelvic fractures resulting in blood loss and hypovolemia have a mor-tality rate between 3% and 20%.\\n24With increasing fracture severity, that is, more pos-\\nterior pelvic disruption, the pelvic venous plexus, and internal iliac vessels are at an\\nincreased risk of injury and subsequent uncontrolled hemorrhage.

The extremity often feels tight and the soft tissues are lesscompressible than the contralateral limb. ACS remains a clinical diagnosis; however,\\ntools to measure intramuscular pressure and tissue oxygenation can be used to\\nconfirm the clinical diagnosis, which can be extremely useful in making the diagnosisin the obtunded patient. When obtaining intramuscular pressure measurements, a dif-\\nference of less than 30 mm Hg from the diastolic blood pressure is concerning for\\nACS. Once ACS is diagnosed, emergent fasciotomies are performed to relieve thepressure and prevent further myoneural ischemia.\\nVascular Injury\\nA vascular injury should be suspected if the injured extremity shows signs of pallor,reduced temperature, prolonged capillary refill, and reduced pulses. Before further ex-\\namination, gross limb length and alignment should be obtained and the limb re-\\nexamined. The ankle-brachial index should be obtained if a vascular injury is sus-pected with a value of 0.90 or lower having a high positive predictive value for an asso-ciated vascular injury.\\n25Re-establishment of the blood supply to the limb is an\\nemergency because muscle necrosis begins to occur within 6 hours of injury. Close\\ncoordination with the vascular surgeon is vital because each surgical plan dependson the other. The sequence of the surgical procedure must be discussed to maximize\\ncare and minimize the ischemia time and risk of further injury to the patient and\\nvascular repair if skeletal stabilization is done after the vascular repair.\\nMajor Joint Dislocations\\nThe close proximity and tethering of neurovascular structures to joints places them atsignificant risk of injury in joint dislocation. Localized soft-tissue swelling, distal ex-tremity edema, abnormal neurology or the signs of vascular compromise are all\\nmarkers for a high index of suspicion of a major joint dislocation. Expedient joint relo-\\ncation and stabilization in a splint or traction may be necessary. Unlike most disloca-tions, a hip dislocation is considered an orthopedic emergency and should be reducedimmediately on recognition because an increased time to reduction is associated with\\nsubsequent development of avascular necrosis.\\n26\\nSCORING SYSTEMS: ARE THEY RELIABLE?\\nThe decision to perform limb salvage or an amputation remains difficult. Scoring sys-tems, such as the Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS)\\n27and Limb Salvage In-\\ndex (LSI),28have been developed to help guide surgeons in their decision-making\\nprocess. However, the decision to salvage or amputate a limb often requires more fac-\\ntors to be considered than those commonly used in the scoring systems. As a result,\\ntheir utility came into question and, in 2001, Bosse and colleagues29found that, out of\\nall scoring systems evaluated, the MESS; the LSI; the Predictive Salvage Index; theNerve Injury, Ischemia, Soft-Tissue Injury, Skeletal Injury, Shock, and Age of Patient\\nScore; and the Hannover Fracture scale-98, none were able to predict the need for\\namputation in a large, multicenter prospective observational study. In 2008, Ly andcolleagues\\n30followed the same set of patients and found that the same scoring sys-\\ntems also lacked the ability to predict outcome and patient recovery following high-\\nenergy lower extremity trauma. Scoring systems also do not seem to have utilitywhen treating severe combat injuries, as demonstrated by Sheean and colleagues.\\n31\\nOther clinical examination findings have been considered in the decision-making\\nprocess, such as the presence of plantar sensation on presentation. In fact, theStinner & Edwards 1124'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'MSK_trauma.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='absence of plantar sensation has historically been a primary reason for orthopedic and\\ngeneral surgeons to consider acute amputation.32However, an analysis performed by\\nBosse and colleagues33of subjects presenting without plantar sensation compared\\nwith matched controls following high-energy trauma demonstrated no difference in\\noutcomes between groups at 2 years. Therefore, the treating surgeon should use allfactors that are available in helping to make the decision and not hang their hat on\\n1 scoring system or 1 primary clinical examination finding. In addition, when time per-\\nmits, that is, the patient is not in extremis, it is always helpful to confer with colleagues,other members of the trauma team, and, when able, the patient before the decision is\\nmade to amputate or salvage a severely injured extremity because there may be other\\nfactors to consider.\\nWHEN SHOULD IT BE FIXED?\\nOne of the frequent discussions among orthopedic and general surgeons revolvesaround the appropriate timing to stabilize fractures. Although the discussion is often\\nshort and indications for urgent operative stabilization in those with isolated extrem-\\nities is rather clear, the discussion can be longer and may involve multiple servicesin the polytrauma patient because more factors must be considered to ensure thatthe surgical intervention does not increase patient morbidity. Ideally, the right surgery\\nis performed for each patient, personally tailored to their physiologic status. The term\\nused to describe this is the application of early appropriate care (EAC). However, toapply EAC, what constitutes appropriate care must be understood. To do so, it is help-\\nful to understand both sides of the historical argument between early total care (ETC)\\nand damage control orthopedics (DCO), which can be used to selectively provideappropriate care, depending on the patient’s clinical status and response to resusci-\\ntation. Although most research evaluating optimal timing of fracture fixation is\\ncentered on the femur, the principles can be applied to fractures of other long bonesand the pelvic ring.\\nEarly Total Care\\nPatients with unstable fractures of the femur, pelvis, acetabulum, and spine are oftenforced into a recumbent position, which predisposes them to pulmonary complica-\\ntions and prolonged systemic inflammation. Early stabilization of these injuries can\\nlead to improved pain relief and mobility. Several studies have clearly demonstratedthe benefits of ETC. Harvin and colleagues\\n34published their decade of experience\\ncomparing femur fractures definitively stabilized with intramedullary nails before and\\nafter 24 hours. After adjusting for anatomic (Injury Severity Score [ISS]) and physio-logic (Revised Trauma Score) indices, early fracture fixation was independently asso-\\nciated with a reduction in pulmonary complications by nearly 60%. It was also\\nassociated with a reduction in ventilator days, hospital length of stay, and overall hos-pital charges. These results are similar to those demonstrated by Vallier and col-leagues,\\n35who compared definitive fixation of unstable femur, acetabulum, pelvis,\\nand thoracolumbar fractures performed before and after 24 hours. After adjusting\\nfor age and ISS, days in the intensive care unit and total hospital stay were lowerwith early fixation. In addition, there were greater than 10% fewer overall complica-\\ntions (24% vs 35.8%), and lower rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome\\n(ARDS), pneumonia, and sepsis in those undergoing early versus delayed fixation.\\nAs this evidence suggests, early definitive treatment may be safely used for patients\\nwith multiple injuries. However, ETC is not ideal for all patients because there is a clear\\nsubset of patients who benefit from DCO.Musculoskeletal Trauma 1125'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'MSK_trauma.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='Damage Control Orthopedics\\nAs the pendulum swung toward ETC, it was realized that not all patients did well hav-\\ning their fractures undergo definitive stabilization early. In fact, some types of patientsseemed to do quite poorly with ETC. It became apparent that in certain patients,\\nparticularly those with pulmonary or head injuries, a less aggressive approach to frac-\\nture fixation might be needed. Trauma causes a sustained response of the immunesystem and the early hyperinflammatory response is often followed by a hypoinflam-\\nmatory stage. In the polytrauma patient, extended surgery, which can lead to\\nincreased blood loss, hypothermia, and surgical trauma, can result in an excessive in-flammatory reaction, which has been termed the second hit. In these patients, exten-\\nsive surgical procedures can overwhelm the immune system, which can trigger a\\npulmonary complication, such as ARDS, or multiple organ failure.\\n36\\nOne alternative is delayed fracture care, that is, splinting or traction, of unstable\\nfractures and performing surgical skeletal stabilization days to weeks later. Before\\nthe advent of modern surgical skeletal stabilization techniques, this was the norm.There are, however, significant disadvantages to delayed fracture care. In patientswithout adequate stabilization, in the case of the femur this would usually involve\\nsome form of skeletal traction, patients cannot be mobilized. As a result, they are at\\nan increased risk for pulmonary complications and pressure ulcers. With the advance-ment in surgical skeletal stabilization techniques, there was a shift toward aggressive\\nearly stabilization of extremity fractures but, as alluded to earlier, ETC is not appro-\\npriate for everyone. Thus, the emergence of DCO.\\nDCO involves doing the necessary surgical interventions to stabilize the fracture to\\nminimize excessive blood loss, improve pain, and promote mobilization. This usually in-\\nvolves procedures such as external fixation of long bone fractures or unstable pelvic ringinjuries. Through the placement of external fixation in the acute period, that is, avoidingopen and often lengthy and/or bloody surgical procedures, the second hit is theoretically\\navoided and definitive reconstruction can occur at a later point after the patient’s phys-\\niologic parameters have improved. The benefits of this strategy on the immune systemhave been demonstrated by Pape and colleagues.\\n37In a prospective, randomized, multi-\\ncenter study, 35 polytrauma subjects (ISS >16) with a diaphyseal femur fracture were ran-\\ndomized to either ETC or DCO, and serum inflammatory markers were trended over time.In those with ETC (intramedullary nail), there was a sustained increase in serum inflamma-\\ntory markers, which was not seen in the DCO group following both the initial external fix-\\nation and subsequent conversion to definitive fixation with an intramedullary nail.\\nIn a retrospective study, Harwood and colleagues\\n38compared the Systemic Inflam-\\nmatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) Score and Marshall multiorgan dysfunction score\\nof subjects with femur fractures treated with either ETC or DCO. It was not surprisingthat the DCO group had more severe injuries based on the new ISS, and more headand thoracic injuries. Despite this, they had a smaller, shorter postoperative SIRS and\\ndid not suffer significantly more pronounced organ failure than the ETC group. Interest-\\ningly, those in the DCO group who underwent conversion to an intramedullary nail whentheir SIRS score was raised suffered the most pronounced subsequent inflammatory\\nresponse and organ failure, which emphasizes the impact that the second hit can have\\nand the importance of planning the definitive fixation based on physiologic improvement.\\nEarly Appropriate Care: When to Choose Early Total Care Versus Damage Control\\nOrthopedics\\nWhat is very clear is that stable patients should be treated with ETC, whereas unstable\\npatients should undergo DCO.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'MSK_trauma.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='clinical indications to perform DCO or ETC in the borderline patient. Various definitions\\nof the borderline patient have been made to include that by Pape and colleagues,37\\nwho define it by the following: ISS greater than 40, multiple injuries (ISS >20) in com-\\nbination with thorax trauma, multiple injuries in combination with severe abdominal or\\npelvic injury, hemorrhagic shock at the moment of administration, moderate or severehead trauma, radiographic evidence of pulmonary contusion, bilateral femur fractures,\\nor a body temperature below 35\\n/C14C.36D’Alleyrand and O’Toole39have proposed 3\\ncommon indicators for DCO of borderline patients that they use at the R. Adams Cow-ley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, MD: (1) closed head injury, (2) poor response to\\nresuscitation in the first 12 hours, and (3) poor respiratory status at the time of fracture\\ntreatment.\\nIt is helpful to know where these indications have come from and what defines an\\nappropriate response to resuscitation to safely apply them. One increasingly used\\nmethod of assessing response to resuscitation is trending lactate levels. In patients\\nundergoing definitive fixation of a femur fracture with an intramedullary nail within24 hours of injury, admission lactate is significantly associated with pulmonary com-\\nplications when other factors such as age, Glasgow Coma Scale, and AIS were\\ncontrolled. However, preoperative lactate was not found to be a risk factor.\\n40A me-\\ndian preoperative lactate of 2.8 mmol/L was not associated with increased pulmonary\\ncomplications, as opposed to previous publications.41These results are similar to\\nthose seen by Vallier and colleagues35,42in which admission lactate, in addition to\\nthe severity of the abdominal and thoracic injuries, contribute most to the develop-\\nment of pulmonary morbidity. It is likely that the trend in lactate, that is, a lactate level\\nimproving and approaching 2.5 mmol/L, demonstrates an adequate response toresuscitation and, therefore, can lead to safe application of ETC. On the contrary, inthose with closed head injuries, severe abdominal, or severe thoracic injuries, DCO\\nshould be considered.\\nThis was also demonstrated in a review by Vallier and colleagues\\n42of subjects with\\npelvis, acetabulum, spine, and/or proximal or diaphyseal femur fractures treated sur-\\ngically. Pulmonary complications occurred in 12% of subjects with 8.2% developing\\npneumonia. Lactate levels were greater with pulmonary complications and were thesingle most specific predictor of complications. An uncomplicated course was asso-\\nciated with absence of a chest injury and definitive fixation within 24 or 48 hours. The\\ninvestigators concluded that complications can be minimized when isolated fracturesare treated on early and, when patients have injuries to other body systems and/or se-vere hemorrhage, DCO may be advisable to optimize outcomes.\\nIn summary, if the patient demonstrates any physiologic signs of end-organ hypo-\\nperfusion, DCO should be pursued. It is also important for the orthopedic surgeon tocommunicate with both the general surgeon and the anesthetist so that care is opti-\\nmized. This allows the treatment plan to be altered in an effort to optimize the patient’s\\noutcomes if the patient’s physiologic parameters change throughout the resuscitationprocess or surgical procedure.\\nSUMMARY\\nSevere extremity injuries are not only a challenge to treat but doing so results in high\\nresource utilization and often high levels of levels of disability.3,43The decision to pur-\\nsue DCO versus ETC may lead to a shorter hospital stay and fewer complications, butthere is likely more that surgeons can do optimize patient outcomes throughout the\\nentire care continuum beyond the decisions made or actions taken within the first\\nfew hours following injury.

In World War II, he commanded the 7th Panzer Division during the 1940 invasion of France. His leadership of German and Italian forces in the North African campaign established his reputation as one of the ablest tank commanders of the war, and earned him the nickname der Wüstenfuchs, \"the Desert Fox\". Among his British adversaries he had a reputation for chivalry, and his phrase \"war without hate\" has been uncritically used to describe the North African campaign.[2] A number of historians have since rejected the phrase as a myth and uncovered numerous examples of German war crimes and abuses towards enemy soldiers and native populations in Africa during the conflict.[3] Other historians note that there is no clear evidence Rommel was involved or aware of these crimes,[4] with some pointing out that the war in the desert, as fought by Rommel and his opponents, still came as close to a clean fight as there was in World War II.[5] He later commanded the German forces opposing the Allied cross-channel invasion of Normandy in June 1944.'),\n",

His leadership of German and Italian forces in the North African campaign established his reputation as one of the ablest tank commanders of the war, and earned him the nickname der Wüstenfuchs, \"the Desert Fox\". Among his British adversaries he had a reputation for chivalry, and his phrase \"war without hate\" has been uncritically used to describe the North African campaign.[2] A number of historians have since rejected the phrase as a myth and uncovered numerous examples of German war crimes and abuses towards enemy soldiers and native populations in Africa during the conflict.[3] Other historians note that there is no clear evidence Rommel was involved or aware of these crimes,[4] with some pointing out that the war in the desert, as fought by Rommel and his opponents, still came as close to a clean fight as there was in World War II.[5] He later commanded the German forces opposing the Allied cross-channel invasion of Normandy in June 1944.'),\n",
